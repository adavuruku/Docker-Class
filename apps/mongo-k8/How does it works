Note:
kubectl get services 
will have <pending> in the external IP columns

to get the external ip to access our load balancer service: execute command

minikube service mongo-express-service

this will generate an external IP for us.

example http://192.168.64.2:30000/ notice the port 30000 is the port we specify in our loadbalancer service nodeport property

in real life production the host cloud will have a configured load balancer external IP address you can put here.

how it works

user make request using the external Ip of mongo-express [loadBalancer Service] at port 30000

the request is then root to mongo-express throught it container port [8081]

mongo-express through mongo service [27017] define in our mongo deployment  connects to MongoDB
