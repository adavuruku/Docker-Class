K8 COMPONENTS

###############################

Node: physical or virtual machine

###############################

Pod: smallest unit of kubernetes (the application to run ) / in docker(container)
(pod uses service/v network to communicates)
pod is an abstraction (copy of container) ontop of container

###############################

virtual network -> every pod has its own Ip address
(when a pod die and restart a new IP is created)

###############################

service: to avoid getting a new IP for every POD, service are used in place of the virtual IP
even if a POD dies the service keeps its network and IP address.
permanent Ip and is also a load balancer

###############################

External service: are service that opens the application to external services
Internal service: are service to communicate internally withing the services

###############################

Ingres -> ingress hanlde the forward of request between the external services and internal services

###############################

ConfigMap: is the external configuration of your application [POD] (username, password,)
It holds apps configuration such that a change in configuration wouldnt mean for one to redeploy the app

###############################

Secret: is like config map but its use to store secret data in base64 encoded format (username, password, certificate etc)

###############################

If pod is restarted all its data will be gone.
(ee.g a daatabase pod once restart will create a new empty instance thereby loosing all its previous contents)
to avoid this use

Volumes ->it attaches a physical storage to a pod which could be on the node or remote outside k8 clustres
Notes : the external storage are not manage by K8

###############################

Deployment: can be use to define how a Node can be replicated to run our application
they're abstraction (copy of pods) ontop of pods
its a pod blue prints
Note: DB Pods cant be replicated because its stateful
Deployment are only use to replicate stateless pod

###############################

StatefulSet: a deployment type use for stateful set like Database
they can be use to replicate stateful pods
it make sure db read and write are in sync through the replication

Note: its advisable to only host stateles app in k8
things like db should be host externally
