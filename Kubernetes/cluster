In a cluster set up, you have

2 Master nodes
3 Worker node

note the hardware resource (cpu, ram and storage) of Master and worker node differs


Master processes are more important but they have less resources since worker node do all the processing

if your application demands increases, you can add more master nodes
or add more worker nodes to an exisiting Master nodes

Master Node -> [one to many] -> Worker node -> [one to many] -> pods
